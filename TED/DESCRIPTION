Description: TED is comprised of the deconvolution modules and the embedding learning module. The deconvolution module leverages cell type-specific expression profiles from scRNA-seq and implements a fully Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the posterior distribution of cell type composition and cell type-specific gene expression from bulk RNA-seq expression of tumor samples. The embedding learning module uses Expectation-maximization (EM) to approximate the tumor expression using a linear combination of tumor pathways while conditional on the inferred expression and fraction of non-tumor cells estimated by the deconvolution module.
